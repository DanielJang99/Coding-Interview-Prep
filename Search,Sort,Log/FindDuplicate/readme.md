# Find Duplicate - Optimize for Space

We have a list of integers, where:

1. The integers are in the range 1..n1..n
2. The list has a length of n+1n+1

It follows that our list has at least one integer which appears at least twice. But it may have several duplicates, and each duplicate may appear more than twice.

**Write a function which finds an integer that appears more than once in our list.** (If there are multiple duplicates, you only need to find one of them.) **Optimize for space!!!**
